#Auto_Church

An intelligence forgiveness-seeking program where good-concepts are prioritzed, and ecological-help that is created-from user-accounts which raises a debt_ceiling that accumatlates, and mints CHURCH tokens over-time that are an immediate-reflection of good-deeds, and acts, or civic-duties, and fully-representable, as a transparent, and background-noise balancer, which is influeced-by the user, or stakeholder, and results in less "negative_consequences", and more "eco_grants" for capability, negotiating a long-term relationship with the system, granted-that auto_church accumulation has collected-enough "good_deeds" from the stakeholder, or user-account when the response was given.

Auto_Church doesn-not automatically-generate tokens, or Karma; Auto_Church holds accountability in moral-standing of stakeholders, and user-accounts based-on rules they create, and how strict policies are, including-if the end-result is a consequnce that harms, or causes-death of any living-creature, or lifeform ; Auto_Church collects this data, while meeting compliance.

Auto_Church, also, is a sponsor_distributor, and gtrants funding, and sponsorship to projects that support homelessness-relief, ecological-sutatainability, math, science, and geometry, etc. to ensure these NPO projects, organizations, and companies receive the funding that they need, with Rust programming, and ALN policy-compliance in-order-to maintain-operations, or receive the computational-power, or resources required-to function, without-involving monetary, or financial-systems.
