The Auto_Church “Altar” is the **governed classroom and proposal gate** that sits *inside* your sovereignty stack and feeds it safely; it never becomes a separate treasury or authority.

### What the Altar does

- Routes donations as **non‑custodial inputs** into teaching/research capacity (time, infra, scholarships), not as a financial control surface or opaque fund. [ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_90c8124f-19ff-4978-9a68-968f40874efe/f55b86b2-4cb4-4528-a86b-d373dcbed56f/home-finance-travel-shopping-a-dNHOagaRTy6u.Z7jAK0olQ.md)
- Treats “students” and “lessons” as **SovereignArtifacts / KOs** that live in append‑only ledgers like `.evolve.jsonl` and `.donutloop.aln` under SMART/EVOLVE/CHAT governance. [ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_90c8124f-19ff-4978-9a68-968f40874efe/5585bbfe-3697-4148-8d2f-488c5adfddff/exposnitc-home-documentation-r-JMz5tz7mTBSre01.8d2hHA.md)
- Acts as a **Cortex‑Gate route** (e.g. `AUTO_CHURCH_ALTAR`) where every action (donate, propose lesson, promote design) is evaluated by a PolicyEngine enforcing RoH ≤ 0.3, neurorights, stake, and token rules before it can touch kernels, XR‑grids, or nanoswarms. [ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_90c8124f-19ff-4978-9a68-968f40874efe/2a657fd1-afb9-4137-93a7-a26d80e9f642/architecting-verifiable-safety-rae5X4JZRh6OB7BgEPQgQA.md)

### How lessons become upstream proposals

Every “learned” or proposed item at the Altar is turned into:

- A `SovereignArtifact` + `EvolutionProposalRecord` with:
  - A **RoH slice** and predicted impact, checked against `.rohmodel.aln` for ceiling 0.3 and monotone safety. [ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_90c8124f-19ff-4978-9a68-968f40874efe/09bcc510-6168-455d-b732-705c1f2ebfe3/can-nanopolycompatible-particl-jfl63HWSQf2O3RU83AuTjg.md)
  - A **neurorights posture** from `.neurorights.json` (mental privacy, cognitive liberty, dream‑sensitive, non‑commercial neural data). [ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_90c8124f-19ff-4978-9a68-968f40874efe/5585bbfe-3697-4148-8d2f-488c5adfddff/exposnitc-home-documentation-r-JMz5tz7mTBSre01.8d2hHA.md)
  - A **governance path**:
    - SMART for small, reversible pedagogical/interface tuning.  
    - EVOLVE for deep structural changes (kernels, lifeforce envelopes, civic / XR‑grid rules).  
    - CHAT for non‑actuating deliberation and weighting (including AI‑drafted lessons). [ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_90c8124f-19ff-4978-9a68-968f40874efe/f55b86b2-4cb4-4528-a86b-d373dcbed56f/home-finance-travel-shopping-a-dNHOagaRTy6u.Z7jAK0olQ.md)

Only proposals that are low‑RoH, neurorights‑respecting, and high‑utility are eligible to be “taken seriously” upstream and passed to sovereign kernels or civic stacks. [ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_90c8124f-19ff-4978-9a68-968f40874efe/2a657fd1-afb9-4137-93a7-a26d80e9f642/architecting-verifiable-safety-rae5X4JZRh6OB7BgEPQgQA.md)

### Moral_position (mp) at the Altar

- **mp** is the ethical fitness score for teachings/designs before they leave Auto_Church space.  
- A high‑mp proposal must:
  - Reduce or not increase modeled harm.  
  - Respect mental privacy and cognitive liberty.  
  - Avoid exploitative monetization of neural or biophysical assets. [ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_90c8124f-19ff-4978-9a68-968f40874efe/09bcc510-6168-455d-b732-705c1f2ebfe3/can-nanopolycompatible-particl-jfl63HWSQf2O3RU83AuTjg.md)
- mp interacts with SMARTEVOLVECHAT:
  - High‑mp, low‑RoH → eligible for SMART/EVOLVE support and further evaluation.  
  - Low‑mp or neurorights‑violating → rejected or quarantined, but still logged immutably in `.donutloop.aln` for audit and learning. [ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_90c8124f-19ff-4978-9a68-968f40874efe/2a657fd1-afb9-4137-93a7-a26d80e9f642/architecting-verifiable-safety-rae5X4JZRh6OB7BgEPQgQA.md)

### Rust / Tsafe / Cortex‑Gate perspective

- The Altar is a **Cortex‑Gate route + capability surface**, behind a Tsafe PolicyEngine that:
  - Loads RoH, neurorights, stake, and token specs from ALN/JSON shards.  
  - Applies them to each “lesson action” (read/write shards, propose evolve, schedule grid changes). [ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_90c8124f-19ff-4978-9a68-968f40874efe/9db70f08-688a-47d5-8aa9-b8f1809b2ff2/please-create-docs-infranet-md-3QCUVaPJQpSb8WxT3w5CIA.md)
- All high‑risk Altar interactions (including AI‑assisted teaching and curriculum generation) produce **DonutloopEntry** records so you can replay how donations, teachings, and promotions were filtered and prove that no step bypassed sovereign invariants. [ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_90c8124f-19ff-4978-9a68-968f40874efe/f55b86b2-4cb4-4528-a86b-d373dcbed56f/home-finance-travel-shopping-a-dNHOagaRTy6u.Z7jAK0olQ.md)

So the Auto_Church Altar is the **pedagogical and governance membrane**: it accepts donations and proposals, teaches and labels moral_position, and only uplifts knowledge that remains RoH‑bounded, neurorights‑compliant, and traceable into your sovereign kernels and civic systems.
